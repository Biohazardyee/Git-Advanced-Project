At the end of the day, Carbon finally comes back home and goes directly to his trunk, to see his marvelous dishwasher.
He opens it and finally sees it after this long day, he is so happy! However, it isn't a shared feeling. As soon as the dishwasher is free, they tell him: "Q1".

Prompt 9.2:
"You know, this is not the kind of women we're used to meet. Although, I'd be glad to marry this dishwasher."

How dare you do this to me Carbon... you were the one that I was trusting, the one that I was loving... You're such a disgusting person..

Narration good_ending:
You kissed the bride and are now spending a happy life with Clem69. You're living together happily in a huge house, sharing dishes between each other. 

Narration sad_ending:
You were not a man and decided to run away. You also put Clem69 into the dump. They passed away from obsolescence about 10 years later. You are now banned from society. What a shame!

Narration best_ending:
You didn't only kiss the bride, you also went straight for a Honeymoon. You are the most loved person on the planet and are happy living with Clem69. You had a lot of miniature and portable dishwashers that can speak, and were buried together after more than 80 years spent together.

# Synopsis

A dishwasher has been abandoned by its owners in the terrible dishwasher's cemetery named DARTY to be recycled.
However, the logistic services of DARTY forgot about it and the dishwasher is becoming really sad.
One day, an intern was verifying the stocks as he had nothing to do and tripped over the dishwasher.
After a few seconds, he realized what he had stumbled upon.
a magnificent dishwasher, with full options, in a perfect working state, which had slept here over 1 hour! What a shame.
He instantly took a pallet truck and took the dishwasher in his car. It was love at first sight.

He had one idea for his future: Marry the dishwasher.
